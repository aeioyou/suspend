# suspend
suspend/resume a list of processes in Windows  
I write this for replacing pssuspend.exe in Sysinternals in daily usage.  
  
Suspend processes which are not needed to save CPU usage.  
ex: suspend a game to play another game smoothly. (suspend the other game when lol starts)  

[lastest build from appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/craftwar_appveyor/suspend/artifacts/suspend/release/suspend.7z) (when I am lazy to make realease on github) 

If you get missing dll error, try to install [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
